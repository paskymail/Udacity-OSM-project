# OpenStreetMap Data Case Study

## Map Area
Sevilla, Andalusia, Spain

- [https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/342563](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/342563)

This map is of my hometown, so I can easily check for data accuracy.

## Files used
1. Data.py
   It is used to parse the Open Street Map XML and create the following 5 tables on csv
   1. nodes.csv: contains the node information 
      - id: primary key
      - user: user name of the creator
      - uid: user Id
      - version
      - lat: latitude
      - lon: longitude
      - timestamp
      - changeset
  
   2. nodes_tags.csv: contains the tags asociated to the aforementioned nodes
      - ind: primary key
      - id:foreign key to the node id
      - key:the catalogue of tag
      - value: 
      - type: type of tag
  
   3. ways.csv: contains the way information 
      - id: primary key
      - user: user name of the creator
      - uid: user Id
      - version
      - timestamp
      - changeset
  
   4. ways_tags.csv: contains the tags asociated to the aforementioned nodes
      - Ind: primary key
      - id:foreign key to the way id
      - key:the catalogue of tag
      - value: 
      - type: type of tag

   5. ways_nodes.csv: contains the tags asociated to the aforementioned nodes
      - id:foreign key to the way id
      - node_id: foreign key to the node id
      - position: position in the list of nodes belonging to the way

   The Ind primary keys on the tags are added in order to update only these rows in the database when changes are made

2. QSL data.py:
   It is used to create the SQL database (named OSMSevilla.db) where the tables are a mirror of the aforementioned csv tables.

3. OSM Queries.sql:
   It is used to perform queries to OSMDB.db using sqlite.
   This queries are then transferred to the OSM audit.py to select only the problematic data to be treated. Only the problematic rows are treated to be corrected when possible.

4. OSM audit.py:
   It is used to perform changes to the OSMDB.db in order to correct the problems found. 
   1. It performs queries to the DB to select only the problematic rows (when possible) and imports them into dataframes
   2. This dataframes are transformed and corrected
   3. the corrected dataframes are then exported to the database for update

## Problems encountered in the Map
The first encountered problem was handling Unicode strings as the Spanish alphabet uses several special characters which where not correctly handled when converted to UTF-8 by DictWriter. Fortunately Python 3's built-in csv module supports Unicode natively by selecting encoding='utf-8-sig' when opening the csv. It worked!

Once ready, I screened a small sample size area around my house (so I know all the places around) and I run it against the data.py file done during the lesson exercises obtaining the DBTest.db

Once I got an idea of the problems I could found, I created the OSMSeville.db from the complete map of Seville (87MB) using the data.py and SQL data.py files.

Note that in SQL data.py I added an index as primary key to the nodes_tags and ways_tags tables so I can perform the update of selected rows by index.

Once, my database was ready, I followed the steps below to systematically screen the values of the tags:

   1. First, I filtered the tags by address type, since it should be the most regular. Here below I list the problems per found per key:
      1. Country
         1. No issues, all values to "ES"
      2. State
         1. State key should be replaced by Country
      3. Province
         1. No issues, all values to "Sevilla"
      4. City
         1. Some values of Sevilla are not correctly written or are in another language
         2. Some values included neighborhoods as for example " Sevilla / Casco Antiguo / San Bartolom√© but seems structured and easy to undstand
      5. Postcode
         1. No issues, all postal codes are consistent
      6. Zip
         1. Zip key should be replaced by Postalcode
      7. Street
         1. Some abbreviations are found, although rare.
      8. House number
         1. There are some numbers with access letter associated, finding 3 acc A and 3A
         2. Some contains a list in 2 different forms: "1;2;3;4;5" "and 1-2-3-4-5". 


   2. Then  I took a look to the rest of tags types. Here below I list the problems per found per key:
      1. Phone
         1. Some keys where of type contact and other type regular
      2. Color
         1. Some colors are in HEX (#D6B290) and others as a color noun.

### 1.2 and 1.6 Replace and consolidate tag keys
In the file audit.py I created the functions to update any chosen column in accordance with a given dictionary.

In this case we will remove some redundant tag keys and change them by more appropriate ones.

The query filters the results to only treat the desired keys ("zip" and "state")

```python 
def update_name(name, mapping):
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    for k, v in mapping.items():
        if re.search(rf"{k}", name, re.IGNORECASE):
            name = name.replace(k,mapping[k])      
    return name

def update_tags(df, column, mapping):
    df2 = df
    dummy = "a"
    for i, row in df.iterrows():
        dummy = row[column]
        df2[column][i]= update_name(dummy, mapping)
    return df2

query_tag_keys = """
SELECT ind, key, value
FROM nodes_tags
where (key = "zip") or (key = "state");
"""
mapping_keys = { 
             "zip": "postcode",
             "state": "country", 
            }

tag_keys = pd.read_sql_query(query_tag_keys, conn)

Corrected_keys = update_tags(tag_keys, "key", mapping_keys)
````

As it can be seen, both update_tags and update_name functions can be used for any correction. Only the query and mapping changes.

Therefore, for the next corrections only the query and mapping will be given as the other functions are reused.

Finally the following function is used to update the database with the information contained in the corrected dataframe

```python
def update_table_from_dataframe(conn, df, table):
    """ update a table from the dataform
    :param conn: Connection object
    :param df: dataform withe the info to update
    :param table: table to be updated
    :return:
    """
    try:
        cursor=conn.cursor()
        # creating column list for insertion
        cols = ",".join([str(i) for i in df.columns.tolist()])
        # Insert DataFrame recrds one by one.
        for i,row in df.iterrows():
            sql = "REPLACE INTO " + table + " ("+cols+") VALUES "+str(tuple(row))+";"
            print(sql)
            cursor.execute(sql)
            # the connection is not autocommitted by default, so we must commit to save our changes
            conn.commit()
    
    except Error as e:
        print(e)
```

In order to be able to update the database easily, I decided to perform two diferent queries: one on the nodes_tags table and the other on the ways_tags tables. 

Note that we can also perform any of the shown queries to the combined nodes_tags and ways_tags tables as they share the same columns.

This can be done by performing the a UNION subquery and then performing the desired query on the subquery. 

Thus we need only to replace

```sql
SELECT ind, key, value
FROM nodes_tags
where (key = "zip") or (key = "state");
```
by the following query including the UNION subquery

```sql
SELECT tags.ind, tags.key, tags.value 
FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags UNION 
      SELECT * FROM ways_tags) as tags
where (tags.key = "zip") or (tags.key = "state");
```

From now on we will only include the query on nodes_tags for simplicity.


### 1.4 standardize Sevilla city
After screening of the city names, I created a dictionary of Sevilla misspelings to replace them by "Sevilla".

```sql
SELECT ind, key, value
FROM nodes_tags
where key = "city" and type = "addr" ;
```

```python 
Corrected_city = update_tags(city, "value", mapping_city)

mapping_city = { 
             "Sevila": "Sevilla",
             "Seville": "Sevilla",
             "Sevillla": "Sevilla",
             "41008": "Sevilla",
             "41010": "Sevilla"
            }   
```

### 1.7 remove street abbreviations
After screening of the street names, I created a dictionary of abbreviations to replace them by the full noun.

```sql
SELECT ind, key, value
FROM nodes_tags
where (key = "street") and type = "addr" ;
```

```python 
Corrected_street = update_tags(street, "value", mapping_street)

mapping_street = { 
             "C/": "Calle",
             "Av.": "Avenida",
             "AVDA.": "Avenida",
             "Ctra.": "Carretera",
             "CTRA.": "Carretera",
             "CRTA.": "Carretera",
             "CR": "Carretera"
            }  
```

### 1.8 standardize house numbers
The following changes are made:
   - remove the acc abbreviation
   - change ";" for "-" in the number list 

```sql
SELECT ind, key, value
FROM nodes_tags
WHERE key = "housenumber" and type = "addr" and (value LIKE '%;%' or value LIKE '%acc%');
```

```python 
Corrected_housenumbers = update_tags(housenumbers, "value", mapping_housenumbers)

mapping_housenumbers = { 
             ";": "-",
             " acc": "", 
            }

````
### 2.1 standardize phone numbers
In the file audit.py the following changes are made:
   - tag type is changed for phone numbers from regular to contact

```sql
SELECT ind, key, value, type
FROM nodes_tags
where (key = "phone") and type = "regular";

```python 
Corrected_phone = update_tags(phone, "type", mapping_phone)

mapping_phone = { 
             "regular": "contact"
            }

````

### 2.2 standardize colors
The follwoing changes are made:
   - the color values that are expresed in nouns are changed into HEX codification

```sql
SELECT ind, key, value
FROM nodes_tags
where (key = "colour") and not value LIKE '%#%';
```

```python 
Corrected_color = update_tags(color, "value", mapping_color)

mapping_color = { 
             "white": "#ffffff",
             "black": "#000000",
             "red": "#ff0000",
             "yellow": "#FFFF00",
             "blue": "#0000FF"
            } 
````


## Other checks performed

### Postal Codes

Once the "zip" key is changed to "postcode", all postcodes are checked for consistency 

```sql
SELECT tags.value, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags 
	  UNION
      SELECT * FROM ways_tags) tags
WHERE tags.key='postcode' and not value LIKE '%41%'
GROUP BY tags.value;
```

Only one postcode was found inconsistent, that should be removed

```sql
	#	value	count
   1	18360	1
```

### Cities included

```sql
SELECT tags.value, tags.key, tags.type, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags UNION ALL 
      SELECT * FROM ways_tags) tags
WHERE tags.key = "city" and not tags.value LIKE "%Sevilla%"
GROUP BY tags.value
ORDER BY count DESC;
```
These are the other cities included, which are correct since they limit with Seville:

```sql
#|value|key|type|count
1|Tomares|city|addr|27
2|Camas|city|addr|25
3|San|Juan|de|Aznalfarache|city|addr|16
4|Castilleja|de|la|Cuestacity|addr|11
5|Alcal√°|de|Guada√≠ra|city|	addr|6
6|Mairena|del|Aljarafe|city|addr|5
7|Alcal√°|de|Guadaira|city|addr|3
8|Coca|de|la|Pi√±eracity|addr|3
9|Dos|Hermanas|city|addr|3
10|Montequinto|city|addr|3
11|camas|city|addr|3
12|Gelves|city|addr|1     
```

# Additional Ideas

## Contributor statistics
The contributions follow a pareto distibution

- Top user contribution percentage (‚Äúerlenmeyer‚Äù) 25.21%
- Combined Top 10 users contribution 69.65%
- Combined user with less than 10 contributions: 61.38% of all users

Which indicates the presence of bots in the 10 biggest contributors. 

## Additional Data Exploration

### Top 10 keys

Let's see what kind of information we can find appart from addr info

```sql
SELECT tags.key, tags.type, COUNT(*) as num
FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags UNION ALL SELECT * FROM ways_tags) tags
WHERE not tags.type = "addr"
GROUP BY tags.key
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Obtaining the following table

```sql
#	key	type	num
1	highway	regular	27465
2	building	regular	21897
3	natural	regular	18217
4	name	regular	17266
5	source	regular	12679
6	levels	building	7886
7	oneway	regular	7881
8	amenity	regular	7275
9	surface	regular	4899
10	leaf_type	regular	4595
```

As we can see there are three main categories

   1. Ways (highway, oneway)
   2. buildings (building, levels, amenity)
   3. nature (natural, leaf_type)

#### 1. ways

This category is all about types of ways, traffic signals... useful by boring for this exercise.

```sql
SELECT tags.key, tags.type, tags.value, COUNT(*) as num
FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags UNION ALL SELECT * FROM ways_tags) tags
WHERE not tags.type = "addr" and (tags.key ="highway" or tags.key ="oneway")
GROUP BY tags.value
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 5;

#	key	type	value	num
1	oneway	regular	yes	7060
2	highway	regular	residential	5964
3	highway	regular	crossing	4319
4	highway	regular	footway	3571
5	highway	regular	service	2685
```

From now on, we will not consider the way tags and only query on the node tags

#### 1. buildings

This category is all about types of buildings... useful by boring for this exercise but also about amenity types, which is better

In the sake of brevety I do not show the query, similar to the one done for ways except that the key filter is set to buildings, levels and amenity.

Let's focus on amenity



```sql
SELECT key, value, COUNT(*) as num
FROM nodes_tags
WHERE  key ="amenity"
GROUP BY value
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 5;

#	key	value	num
1	amenity	bench	1214
2	amenity	bar	654
3	amenity	restaurant	636
4	amenity	parking	524
5	amenity	bicycle_parking	378
```

As we can see there are a lot of bars and restaurant in Seville, which makes sense since it is a quite touristic city.

If we focus ocn the restaurants


#### Most popular cuisines (restaurant, fast food, cafe...)

```sql
SELECT nodes_tags.value, COUNT(nodes_tags.value) as num
FROM nodes_tags JOIN nodes
WHERE nodes_tags.id=nodes.id and nodes_tags.key='cuisine'
GROUP BY nodes_tags.value
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 5;

#	value	num
1	regional	70
2	spanish	58
3	pizza	39
4	tapas	26
5	burger	22
```
#### Most popular cuisines only for restaurants

```sql
SELECT nodes_tags.value, COUNT(*) as num
FROM nodes_tags JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT(id) FROM nodes_tags WHERE value='restaurant') i
WHERE nodes_tags.id=i.id and nodes_tags.key='cuisine'
GROUP BY nodes_tags.value
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 5;

#	value	num
1	regional	59
2	spanish	40
3	pizza	19
4	tapas	19
5	italian	13
```

As we can see, the local food is very popular

let's see how many including everything that sounds like spanish, local, tapas...

```sql
SELECT COUNT(nodes_tags.value) as num
FROM nodes_tags JOIN nodes
WHERE nodes_tags.id=nodes.id and nodes_tags.key='cuisine' and (nodes_tags.value LIKE "%spanish%" or nodes_tags.value LIKE "%local%" or nodes_tags.value LIKE "%regional%" or nodes_tags.value LIKE "%tapas%");
```

We found 189 amenities, which is almost half of the total 414.

#### 3. nature

This category is all about nature.
Perfoming a similar query than for ways, we can find that most of the information is realted to trees (17770 trees), incluidng its type of leaf.


# Suggestions for improving the data or its analysis

As can be seen there is a huge ammount of different information on the tags about very diverse subjects. I think that its structure into key, value, type is too simple and may not be enough.

As a suggestion I would create the concept of datasets. A dataset is a group of fields that always go together since they all descrive the same concept. 

For example address could be a dataset. The dataset Address would contain the datafields: country, state, province, city, postalcode, street, housenumber...

The dataset tree for example could contain the datafields: genus, leaf_cycle, leaf_type...

In the tags we would only refer to the dataset ID and then you could retreive the information of the dataset filds through a join.

For example:

   Node_tag: 
      
   tag.key= dataset_tree, tag.value = 123456, tag.type = dataset

   DATASET:
      
   dataset_tree.id = 123456, dataset_tree.genus = citrus, dataset_tree.leaf_cycle= evergreen, dataset_tree.leaf_type = broadleaved

## 1. Benefits

   1. In this way we would have different dataset tables, all structured in the same way with predefined fields, helping to improve consitency. 

   2. If we were interested only in the city threes we would only consult the table of the trees dataset and via a join with the nodes we could locate them in the map. 

   3. It would make very easy to add data to the map since the datafields information could be stored and mantained in a different website and we only would need to create the dataset tags on OSM. When interested in consulting the datafields of a given dataset in the map, OSM would make a query to the third party website API and get the datafields through the dataset ID.

   4. The datasets can be a closed list so when people want to contribute they will already have the list of possible datasets and they fields, making easier to standardize information 

## 2. Anticipated Problems

   1. People could introduce information as regular tags if they do not realize that a dataset for this pourpose already exists, having the same type of information in two diferent tables (the tag table and the dataset table)

   2. The dataset maintained in third party websites could dissaperar or even change IDs, making the dataset tags obsolete or wrong.

# Conclusion
 I was actualy impressed by the amount of information and its consistency, completness and accuracy. Regarding completness and consistency, I guess OSM checks for it. Regarding accuracy I guess some people from Seville already followed this course!
 I also noticed that the information is sometimes very specific, like the one related to the trees and tree leafs or buildings style and color. It seems that some people are using Open Street Map to perform its invertigations or classifications, which I found a great idea.
